#STM8L101F3P6 Base Image

Expertimental image for STM8L101F3P6. Most things, including NVM and the BG task should work.

The STM8L001J3M3 is even more experimental - it may brick your chip!.

In order to make the binary compatible with the STM8L001J3M3 the TX pin uses low-side GPIO settings (i.e. it requires a pull-up).
