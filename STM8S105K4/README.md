The board is quite attractive since it's cheap (less than $3) and offers 2K RAM, 1K EEPROM and up to 32K Flash (which is quite a lot for the frugal STM8 eForth).

The binary release contains the image STM8S105K4 which can be used for any Medium Density device that communicates through the STM8 UART.

Documenation for this board is in the [Wiki](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/Breakout-Boards#stm8s105k4t6-breakout-board).
